# BusMall Market Research


## User Stories
### Market Research
The market research folks aren't very number savvy so they need a nice chart to show them which products are getting more votes. They are also lazy and often supply images in different formats and sizes. 

### Developer
The developer wants to keep it **DRY** and *elegant* and create a framework to deal with an unknown set of images that are in various formats. The project needs to be well structured and easy to maintain so that it can be re-deployed with updated images. 

### Focus Group Participant
The focus groupie is there for the food or snacks and as quick a possible a payout for their time. Once a month or so they get an email with a link to a survey of items to rate. It would be nice to have it work on whatever device they are using at the moment, often a mobile phone.
